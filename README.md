# TypeScript Express Setup Script

This project provides a convenient script and setup instructions to quickly bootstrap a new TypeScript Express project.

## Features

- Creates a new project directory with a basic Express application structure.
- Initializes a TypeScript (TS) project with recommended tsconfig.json settings.
- Installs necessary dependencies (Express, TypeScript, types).
- Includes scripts for development (with optional Nodemon) and building.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm (or yarn)
- Basic familiarity with setting up web development projects

### Option 1:  Using Homebrew (macOS)

1. Install Homebrew if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```
    Use code with caution.

2. Install the setup script using Homebrew:
    ```bash
    brew install setup-typescript.rb  # Assuming 'setup-typescript.rb' is your formula file
    ```
    Use code with caution.

### Option 2: Using the Installer Script (macOS or Linux)

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Make the installer script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x install_setup.sh
    ```
    Use code with caution.
3. Run the installer script (you'll likely need administrator/sudo privileges):
    ```bash
    sudo ./install_setup.sh
    ```
    Use code with caution.

## Usage

Once installed, run the following command in your terminal to create a new project:
```bash
setup_typescript
```

Use code with caution.

Enter your desired project name when prompted.
Navigate into your project directory (cd your-project-name)
Start the development server (if you included Nodemon):
`npm run dev`
Use code with caution.
Build for production (if you didn't choose Nodemon):
`npm run build`

Start the production server:
`npm start`

## Customization
You can modify the setup_typescript.sh file to further customize the project structure, dependencies, or scripts according to your needs.
